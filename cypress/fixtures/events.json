The Ozora Festival is one of the two sizeable psytrance festivals in Hungary ( the other being Solar United Natives festival), and is one of the largest psychedelic trance festivals in the world. As of 2016, it annualy attracts close to 60,000 people, similar to Boom Festival in Portugal and Antaris Project in Germany who also reach more than 40,000 visitors every year.
